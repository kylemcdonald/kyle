This system was used for performing with TOKiMONSTA during VIA 2010 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Saturday October 2nd 2010.

The app is designed to run with an M-Audio Trigger Finger or other device with continuous control messages on 1-24. I assign 1-16 to the pads and the rest to knobs/sliders.

Hotkeys (1-3, 0) are used to switch scenes. Within each scene, there are further hotkeys generally qwert/asdf. \ toggles fullscreen. / toggles MIDI debug. period and comma control whether the cursor is drawn in text/color music mode.
